# See also: https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code/wiki/Step-1---Creating-a-coarse-mesh
#
# In this example we build a coarse mesh with a cube geometry.
# The cube is meshed with 6 coarse tetrahedra.
# We then output it in vtu format and destroy it.
# 
# How you can experiment here:
#  - Use Paraview to visualize the output files.
#  - Change the parameters of t8_cmesh_new_hypercube
#    You can change the element shape or switch to a partitioned cmesh or use
#    periodic boundaries.
#  - Exchange t8_cmesh_new_hypercube with any other t8_cmesh_new function
#    from t8_cmesh.h to create a different cmesh.

#  Builds cmesh of 6 tetrahedra that build up a unit cube.
#  \param [in] comm   MPI Communicator to use.
#  \return            The coarse mesh.

  # Build a coarse mesh of 6 tetrahedral trees that form a cube.
  # You can modify the first parameter to build a cube with different
  # tree shapes, i.e. T8_ECLASS_QUAD for a unit square with 1 quadrilateral tree.
  # See t8_eclass.h, t8_cmesh.h for all possible shapes.
  # 
  # The second argument is the MPI communicator to use for this cmesh.
  # The remaining arguments are 3 flags that control
  #   do_bcast     - If non-zero only the root process will build the cmesh and will broadcast it to the other processes. The result is the same.
  #   do_partition - If non-zero the cmesh will be partitioned among the processes. If 0 each process has a copy of the whole cmesh.
  #   periodic     - If non-zero the cube will have periodic boundaries. That is, i.e. the left face is connected to the right face.
